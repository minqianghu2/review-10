CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a widely exploited web application. This paper introduces a new variation on CSRF attacks, login CSRF. The attacker will form a cross-site request to the login form, to log the victim into the web as attackers.

CSRF is one of the most exploit security vulnerabilities of 2007. In this paper, the authors examine the e scope and diversity of CSRF vulnerabilities, study existing defenses, and describe incremental and new defenses based on headers and web application firewall rules. 

The definition of login cross-site request is also introduced, which are currently damaging and under-appreciated.

The most widely used methods to defend the CSRF attacks are:  validating a secret request token, validating the HTTP Referer header, and validating custom headers attached to XMLHttpRequests. While the downside is that none of these are satisfactory.
