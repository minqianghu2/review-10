Cryptographic protocols are generally used in distributed system for authentication and other purposes. The authors present sufficient principles for the design of cryptographic protocols.

The principle with enough examples in order to demonstrate the actual applicability of the guidelines is also explained by the authors. 

The authors pick examples from authentication literature, while the principle are applicable elsewhere. 

The authors concentrated on the simple principles with the largest potential applicability and payoff. The literature is full of ingenious protocols and attacks.

Notation common in the literatures are adopted. The notation is not uniform/identical. 

This paper also contains the explanation of the concept and usage of encryption.
