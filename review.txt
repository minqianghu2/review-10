Since traditional web browser are usually designed by the combination of both user and the web with a single protection domain. In this paper, the authors introduce how the security architecture works in the chromium browser. It has two modules in separate protection domain: a browser kermel, and a rendering engine; which helps mitigate the threats from the attackers.
Chromium is the security architecture based on which the Google chrome was built. The components and module from the traditional browsers are allocated separately in browser kernel and the rendering engine, which optimize the security and performance. Rendering machine and the browser kernel are responsible for different tasks in the web browser, .

This architecture must be compatible with the existing web. The Chromium architecture may threat the rendering engine as a black box that is used for taking unparsed HTML as input and produces rendered bitmaps as output.
