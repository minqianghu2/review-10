In this paper, the authors introduce a technique -- Noncespaces,  to enable web clients to distinguish between trusted and untrusted contents to prevent exploitation of vulnerability. By randomize the HTML tags and attributes in the documents, before transferring to the web clients. 

It unveils a serious threat to the modern web applications -- cross-site scripting, as known as XSS. Web browsers protect the web apps with the same browser instance by isolating them according to the Same Origin Policy.

The research target is also limited into XSS attacks to make it deep enough. DOM-based XSS attacks are not considered here since the trusted client-side JavaScript permits the injection of untrusted content in violating the web applications security policy.

In Noncespaces, randomized delimiters in DSI allows the web browser to distinguish between trusted and untrusted content.

The goal of Noncespaces is to let the client to safely display documents that contain both trusted content generated by a web application and untrusted content provided by untrusted users.
