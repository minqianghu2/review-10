This paper pointed out the necessity of the corresponding more robust security to compensate the increased exposure to potential hostile code of  fast growing mobile application technologies. 

The good side is that this paper points out some real world mobile application system problems. It also points out that web browser is different from OSs, which are more rely on the software mechanisms for its basic functionalities. 

The advantages of software protections are that they result in the wellness and completeness of the portability, and the performance of the software.

The protections of Java is worthwhile since Java is a good choice for many reasons:
Its safety of JVM for Java language’s type, the sandbox model provides many useful programs for being written, and etc.

The least common mechanism principle in Java observes the principle to concern the dangers of sharing the state among different programs. It means to discuss the notion of converting storage channels.

The downside of these protection designs are although they have strengths, they are still some weakness. For instance, although the capability system could be implemented naturally in Java, it is only suitable for applications where programs are not used in standard java APIs.
